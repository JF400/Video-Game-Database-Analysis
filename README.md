# Video-Game-Database-Analysis
The dataset contains information about video games that sold more than 100,000 copies. This project migrates the data from the csv file, designs a normalized database, and then creates a series of stored procedures to answer common queries on the dataset.

# Features of the Project
**Creating the Data Model:** We derive the data relationships and create a normalized crows-foot ER model (vgCrow.jpg) for a database to manage this data. <br /> <br /> **Migrating the Data into the Normalized Table Design:** We create the tables necessary for the design including all pk/fk constraints and ensuring all fields have the appropriate data type. Then, we use bulk inserts with nested queries to migrate the data to the appropriate tables. <br /> <br /> **Stored Procedures:** We create four stored procedures to answer common queries on the dataset. <br /> <br /> This project integrates Python, SQL, and database design to great effect.
